[[PageOutline]]

The `sfModelTestPlugin` is a symfony plugin for quickly creating unit tests that require database interaction. Was "sfModelTestPlugin."

== Features ==

 * Uses a separate test database
 * Automatically reloads test data before each group of tests
 * Easy to install and use
 * Support for Propel 1.2, Propel 1.3, and Doctrine
 
== Installation ==

  * Uncompress the archive
  
    {{{  
    #!sh
      cd /path/to/your/symfony/project/plugins/
      tar -xzf /path/to/sfModelTestPlugin-1.0.0.tgz
    }}}

  * Create a database for testing. To load the schema, just use your existing sql

    {{{
    #!sh
      mysql -u username -p myApp_test < data/sql/lib.model.schema.sql
    }}}

  * Add the test database to databases.yml

    {{{  
    #!yml
      all:
        propel:
          class:      sfPropelDatabase
          param:
            phptype:  mysql
            host:     localhost
            database: myApp
            username: myUser
            password: myPasswd
      test:
        propel:
          class:      sfPropelDatabase
          param:
            phptype:  mysql
            host:     localhost
            database: myApp_test
            username: myUser
            password: myPasswd
    }}}

  * Create one or more YAML data files for testing, and put them in tests/fixtures (or wherever). These files are just like the test data files you might put in data/fixtures, except they will be reloaded into the test database at the beginning of every test method. (see "Usage")

  * Create your unit tests! You will need to include the following two lines at the top of your unit tests, (replacing 'myApp' with, of course, the name of your app):

    {{{  
    #!php
      define('SF_APP', 'myApp');
      include(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../plugins/sfModelTestPlugin/bootstrap/model-unit.php');
    }}}

== Usage ==

Unit tests that use this plugin are almost identical in form and function to those in Ruby on Rails. A unit test file will look like this:
  {{{  
  #!php
    define('SF_APP', 'myApp');
    include(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../plugins/sfModelTestPlugin/bootstrap/model-unit.php');

    class myUnitTest extends sfPropelTest
    {
      public function test_user()
      {
        $user = new User();
        $user->setFirstName('Joe');
        $user->setLastName('Smith');
        $user->setUsername('bobbyjoe');
        $user->save();

        $joe = UserPeer::getBy(UserPeer::USERNAME, 'bobbyjoe');
        $this->ok($joe, 'Joe exists!');
      }

      public function test_dataDelete()
      {
        $joe = UserPeer::getBy(UserPeer::USERNAME, 'bobbyjoe');
        $this->ok(!$joe, 'Joe no longer exists.');
      }
    }

    $test = new myUnitTest('/path/to/data.yml');
    $test->execute();
  }}}

Above, sfPropelTest extends an abstract class called sfModelTest, which itself extends lime_test. sfDoctrineTest and sfPropel13Test are also bundled with the plugin. Each unit test is a class that extends one of these. If you are familiar with Rails, the above should look familiar. If not, here is the quick summary:
For every test case, you write a class; every class method that begins with "test_" gets called in turn; before each test method is called, the data is reloaded and the setup() method is called (if you defined one); after each test method is called, the teardown() method is called (if you defined one).
All the test functions available from lime are methods of your class, so call them with $this. The argument to the constructor tells the test where to find the test data. It can be a file, a directory (all YAML files in the directory will be loaded) or nothing (all YAML files in "test/fixtures" will be loaded.)
