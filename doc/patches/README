1. Generators, and filtering on many-to-many relations <juneih@linpro.no>
Generators in Symfony 1.0X does not support filtering on many-to-many
relations. Patching the following file in the symfony core with their
respective patch files will fix this problem:

/usr/share/php/data/symfony/generator/sfPropelAdmin/default/template/actions/actions.class.php
/usr/share/php/symfony/generator/sfAdminGenerator.class.php

Note! The location of your core Symfony files might be in a different
location.
Note! Once you've patched the files, you have to clear the cache so the
generator can create the new correct files. 


2. Routing problem <bjori@linpro.no>
Patch for sfRouting which fixes several issues when retrieving the "internal
URI":

- urlencode()s request keys and values
   Protect against key/value corruption
- Loop over arrays
   Otherwise we wind up with /Array/ in the paths
- Skip empty values
   Protect against seemingly random bogus auto fill-ins 

The file to patch is:
/usr/share/php/symfony/controller/sfRouting.class.php

Note! The location of your core Symfony files might be in a different
location.
